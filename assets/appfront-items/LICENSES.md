editor-realism B1 (2026-10-23): `--polyhaven F:/App-review/homepage-v6/cinema/assets/models --glb <homepage-audit>/public/models --only sofa_02,Armchair_01,dining_chair_02`.
editor-realism B1b (2026-10-23): `--polyhaven F:/App-review/homepage-v6/cinema/assets/models --only sofa_02,modern_arm_chair_01`.
sofa-ph / dining-chair-ph have a single material (wood + fabric in one atlas); armchair-ph has two (legs, pillow). None is named `slot_*`: the colour is fixed and does not follow the scene style.
editor-realism P1 (2026-10-23): `node scripts/realism-assets/plants.mjs F:/tmp/ph-plants/dl` (Poly Haven 1k glTF downloads). Leaves = diffuse + the real alpha map (RGBA webp, MASK 0.5, double sided); triangles cut by dropping whole leaf islands (seeded shuffle) after a light meshopt pass, trunk/pot simplified. plant-ph 7.8k tris, planter-ph 4.8k tris.
editor-realism review2 pack 1 (2026-10-23): pillow/throw-blanket regenerated (roundedBox winding was inside-out); dining-chair-ph diffuse `linear(2.2, 10)` (`--only dining_chair_02`); rug-nf via `node scripts/realism-assets/carpet.mjs`.
editor-realism review2 pack 2A (2026-10-23): downloads in `F:/tmp/ph-pack2/<id>/` (1k glTF). `node scripts/gen-decor-models.mjs --polyhaven F:/tmp/ph-pack2 --only side_table_01,wooden_display_shelves_01,modern_ceiling_lamp_01,hanging_picture_frame_02`; `node scripts/realism-assets/planter-long.mjs F:/tmp/ph-pack2` (planter_box_02 + potted_plant_02; box 1.5k + 3 x 1.4k plants joined into one mesh per material = 5.7k tris; 5 plants cost the dGPU 7 -> 14-21 ms per frame).
editor-realism pack 4B (2026-10-24): `node scripts/realism-assets/cabinets.mjs` -> closet-gen / kitchen-counter-gen / kitchen-cabinet-gen / kitchen-shelf-gen / tv-stand-gen (bounding box = the Pascal box, slot names as the Pascal model + `slot_handle` dark metal, box-projected UV in metres).
