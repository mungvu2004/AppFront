/**
 * The application shell: navigation, data, motion — three things, one place.
 *
 * This file used to render `<App />` directly, which is the nine-screen demo
 * picker, while `src/routes.tsx` declared 28 routes that nothing ever mounted.
 * That meant the first real screen had no way to be reached, `useNavigate` had
 * no router to call, and `src/lib/query` had no provider to run under.
 *
 * The nesting order is deliberate:
 *
 * - `QueryClientProvider` outermost because it draws nothing — it holds the
 *   cache, and the cache has to outlive every route change.
 * - `MotionProvider` wraps the WHOLE shell rather than each screen: it sets
 *   `reducedMotion="user"` once for every framer-motion animation in the tree.
 *   Per-screen leaves room for a screen to forget (R-39).
 * - `RouterProvider` innermost, because it is the only part that changes with
 *   the URL.
 * - `NotificationHost` is a SIBLING of `RouterProvider`, not a parent and not a
 *   child, and that follows from the same three reasons rather than bending
 *   them. A notification outlives the route that published it — a run that
 *   finishes after the user has walked away still has to be able to say so — so
 *   it cannot live under the part that changes with the URL. It draws, so it
 *   belongs inside `MotionProvider` where `reducedMotion="user"` is already set
 *   once for the whole shell (R-39). It uses no router hook and no query, so
 *   standing outside `RouterProvider` costs it nothing.
 *
 *   Before this, `notificationBus` had every rule of a notification and full
 *   tests but no caller anywhere in `src`, and `Toast.tsx` was only ever mounted
 *   by `src/App.tsx` — the demo picker this file stopped rendering. On the real
 *   route tree there was no place for a notification to appear at all. There is
 *   now, and it is one line.
 *
 * The demo picker is not lost: it is the `/demo` route, and only in a
 * development build. `/` is the real dashboard route, `ProjectDashboardRoute`
 * (`src/screens/dashboard/ProjectDashboard/ProjectDashboard.container.tsx`).
